# CovidPortfolioProject
This was my first project while I was following a mentor. My goal was to showcase that I could query data.
My next project will be completely on my own as I'll probably do one on baseball statistics as we are in the playoffs!
The data used can be found

You can see my Tableau dashboard I created from some of the data

Thank you!
