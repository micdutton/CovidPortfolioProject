# CovidPortfolioProject
This was my first project while I was following a mentor. My goals were to find a way to query the data he was asking before he showed how the query was made.
If I was stuck, I'd follow the video and learn a new tool to put in my arsenal.
My next project will be completely on my own as I'll probably do one on baseball statistics as we are in the playoffs!
You can see my Tableau dashboard I created from some of the data here (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.dutton5189/viz/CovidDashboard_16654409873300/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
